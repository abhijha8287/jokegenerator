## 🖼 Example

**Topic**: `"programmers"`  
**Output**:
- **Joke**: Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.  
- **Explanation**: This is a pun. In real life, light attracts insects (bugs). In programming, “bugs” are software errors. Dark mode is preferred both for screen comfort and — humorously — to avoid these "bugs."
